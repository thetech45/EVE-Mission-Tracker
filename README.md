📘 How to Install pip & Run the EVE Mission Tracker
🖥️ What You Need

Windows 10 or 11

Internet connection

Python 3.10 or newer

🔹 STEP 1: Install Python (pip comes with it)

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/

Click Download Python (big yellow button)

Run the installer

⚠️ IMPORTANT (DO NOT SKIP THIS)

On the first installer screen:
✅ Check the box that says
“Add Python to PATH”

Then click:
➡ Install Now

🔹 STEP 2: Verify Python & pip Installed Correctly

Press Windows Key

Type cmd

Press Enter

In the black window, type:

python --version


You should see something like:

Python 3.12.1


Now check pip:

pip --version


If you see a version number → pip is installed correctly ✅

🔹 STEP 3: Install Required Library (requests)

In the same Command Prompt, type:

pip install requests


Wait until it finishes.

You only need to do this once.




🔹 STEP 5: Run the Program (IMPORTANT)

❌ Do NOT double-click the file

✅ Correct way:

Open the folder containing Mission.py

Hold Shift

Right-click inside the folder

Click “Open PowerShell window here” or “Open Terminal here”

Then type:

python Mission.py


Press Enter

🔹 STEP 6: Log In to EVE Online

The app window opens

Click “Login with EVE Online”

Your browser opens

Log in & approve access

Close the browser tab

The app updates with:

Wallet balance

Missions completed

ISK earned from missions

❗ If the Program Opens Then Closes

This means:

Python is not installed correctly

pip is missing

requests is not installed

or CLIENT_ID / SECRET were not set

👉 Always run from Command Prompt, not by double-clicking.
